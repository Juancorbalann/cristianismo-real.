      "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.",
      "The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.",
      "God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.",
      "God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.",
      "God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. There was evening and there was morning, the first day."
